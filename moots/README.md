## wider cranks

My knees hurt. A lot. After short distances.
I'm interested in shortening my crank arms and widening my stance to more
closely match the profile of my old Fuji.

| dimension | ultegra | eeWings |
| --------- | ------- | ------- |
| length | 172.5mm | 170mm |
| bb | Hollowtech II | BSA 68 / 30mm |
| chainline | 43.5mm | depends on chainring |
| q-factor | 146mm | 160mm |
| bcd | 110mm | 110mm |
| bolt pattern | 4 arm | 5 arm |

Making the switch will also require a new BSA 68 / 30mm bottom bracket.
The switch from Hollowtech II to a standard BSA 68 bottom bracket feels
like a good change either way.

It will also require new chainrings. Ideally they will match the 43.5mm
chainline of the original Shimano crankset as close as possible.

## fork upgrade

I want a fork with similar or larger tire clearance, internal wiring for a
dynamo hub, and mount points for cages or panniers and a front light.

## 650b wheels

I'm considering 650b wheels to address toe overlap and allow for running
larger tires.
