## wider cranks

My knees hurt. A lot. After short distances.
I'm interested in shortening my crank arms and widening my stance to more
closely match the profile of my old Fuji.

| dimension | ultegra | eeWings |
| --------- | ------- | ------- |
| length | 172.5mm | 170mm |
| bb | Hollowtech II | BSA 68 / 30mm |
| chainline | 43.5mm | depends on chainring |
| q-factor | 146mm | 160mm |
| bcd | 110mm | 110mm |
| bolt pattern | 4 arm | 5 arm |

Making the switch will also require a new BSA 68 / 30mm bottom bracket.
The switch from Hollowtech II to a standard BSA 68 bottom bracket feels
like a good change either way.

I may also switch to a [new 1x gearing](https://www.gear-calculator.com/?GR=DERS&KB=34,50&RZ=11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,30,34&UF=2281&TF=90&SL=2.6&UN=KMH&DV=ratio&GR2=DERS&KB2=40&RZ2=11,13,15,17,19,21,24,27,31,35,40&UF2=2281) at the same time.

## fork upgrade

I want a fork with similar or larger tire clearance, internal wiring for a
dynamo hub, and mount points for cages or panniers and a front light.

## 650b wheels

I'm considering 650b wheels to address toe overlap and allow for running
larger tires.
