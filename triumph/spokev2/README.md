# spoke v2

Provided by [mrrabbit.net](http://www.mrrabbit.net/wheelsbyflemingapplications.php).

The nice thing about this utility is it lets you compute spoke length for each side of the hub independently.
This is nice for asymmetric hubs or hubs where you might want to run two different cross patterns.
