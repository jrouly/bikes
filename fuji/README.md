# Fuji

The frame is a 1986 Fuji Absolute, originally in Winner Red.

The bike as I purchased it was well used and missing some of the original parts: mismatched wheels (700c front and 27" rear) and an anonymous WTB saddle.
After several thousand miles and several years, it was time to be rebuilt.

I wanted to rebuild the bike with higher end but still (approximately) period appropriate components.
To that end, I would like to eventually install a full SunTour Superbe (4700) groupset.
Until that time comes, I'm keeping a list of the current specs in the always in progress rebuild.

I did get the frame stripped and freshly powder coated as the first step of the rebuild.

I've included the original specifications from the [1986 catalog](https://classicfuji.posthaven.com/1986-fuji-catalog-no-16-edition) as a reference.
